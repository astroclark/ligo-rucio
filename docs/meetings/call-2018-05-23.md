# Quick call to touch base
People: James, Brian

## Certificates
 * Hosts have host certificate
 * To authorize: Talk to Juan about an in-common certificate on rucio-cit

E.g., this is the core LDR certificate:
```
/DC=org/DC=incommon/C=US/postalCode=91125/ST=CA/L=Pasadena/street=1200 E. California Blvd./O=California Institute of Technology/OU=Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory/CN=ldr.ligo.caltech.edu
```

Procedure: contact different servers to add DN to grid map file to a particular directory. For example, at Nebraska:
```
[root@red-gridftp12 ~]# cat /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile  | grep -i calte
"/DC=org/DC=incommon/C=US/postalCode=91125/ST=CA/L=Pasadena/street=1200 E. California Blvd./O=California Institute of Technology/OU=Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory/CN=ldr.ligo.caltech.edu" ligo
```

 * **Action**: James to contact Juan about these

Be aware:
 * Rucio upstream have containerized a lot
 * **Action**: set up server on `rucio.ligo.caltech.edu` using docker container ([Rucio server installation](https://rucio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_server.html#install-via-docker))

Plan B for certification: use james' personal certs
```
"/DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=LIGO/CN=James Clark james.clark@ligo.org" ligo
```

So:
 1. Install LDG client
 1. In rucio config file, point to /tmp certificate: /opt/rucio/etc/rucio.cfg 
 1. **Note**: Brian provided the Nebraska config file as an example.  See: [rucio_example.cfg](https://github.com/astroclark/ligo-rucio/blob/master/server/etc/rucio_example.cfg) 

```
[conveyor]
scheme = srm,gsiftp
transfertool = fts3
ftshosts = https://lcgfts3.gridpp.rl.ac.uk:8446
cacert   = /opt/rucio/etc/web/ca.crt
usercert = /opt/rucio/etc/web/x509up
```

 * Use this fts host: https://fts3-public.cern.ch:8446/
  * Some questions from James about how much LIGO should be relying on 3rd party transfer server
  * Answer: Ok from Brian's perspective, can also use the OSG one: `https://fts.mwt2.org:8446`
  * This will be a point to address / mention explicitly in the evaluation, though.
  * Note that there's no problem moving to different FTS servers

Various notes and configurations pasted from skype:

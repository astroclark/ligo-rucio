# LIGO Rucio Evaluation Call

Objective: touch base on activities
 * What have we done?
 * What are we doing?
 * Identify activities to coordinate
 * Advertise docs / agree on admin

James will take notes and flesh this out later
 
## On-going Activities
### James/Brian:
 * Brian: Test LIGO Rucio instance set up @ Northwestern
 * James: generally been experimenting with command line tools for setting up
   RSEs, transferring files "by hand"
 * Software:
  * [README](https://github.com/astroclark/ligo-rucio/blob/master/README.md)
    with some (incomplete) notes on setting up RSEs, basic commandline tools.
  * Keeping more complete notes in [examples doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5KYTq--jpPxsgC4Rs5X7lh3oiFYkitb1XsupT80yzY/edit) 
  * `gw_data_find`-based script for dataset identification/creation: [insert_lvc_dataset.py](https://github.com/astroclark/ligo-rucio/blob/master/insert_lvc_dataset.py) (should probably overhaul this to eliminate the `pycbc` dependency...)
  * Convert LIGO LFNs to PFNs: [ligo_lfn2pfn.py](https://github.com/astroclark/ligo-rucio/blob/master/lib/ligo_lfn2pfn.py)
* Next Steps & Actions
 * Documentation & specifications: James - understand LDR monitoring to
   determine comparison benchmarks, LDR summary document for comparison
 * Perform dataset replication via the python API

### Dan
 * LIGO rucio instance in LIGO Datagrid environment

## Documentation/Resources (& Questions)
 * rucio [slack channel](rucio.slack.com): worth setting up dedicated channel? 
 * ligo-rucio [github](https://github.com/astroclark/ligo-rucio) repository:
   move to git.ligo.org (make publicly visible)? James' personal github not
   really appropriate
 * LIGO-rucio directory in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GNkNJwJbSXrTRUJzmemmaOJTBMCuzVm5?usp=sharing) -- should be editable by any ligo.org account
  * LDR summary doc [DRAFT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GennSry8jTc3afz7RhYe8XkHrLe--XdejDdP3hJsvRU/edit?usp=sharing)
  * LIGO-rucio "manual" [DRAFT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puk4PPIz9OJAJ4ClgLY_FDW7HDeXkKVIUGybBnZv--4/edit)
  * [Examples/exercises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5KYTq--jpPxsgC4Rs5X7lh3oiFYkitb1XsupT80yzY/edit)

## AOB 
 * Regular meetings? Maybe just a weekly email round-up?
